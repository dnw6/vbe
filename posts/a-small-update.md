I've made a couple of small changes to this site:

* Updated the divider up there ^^^ to a fancier looking wavey shape, courtesy of [https://omatsuri.app/page-dividers/](https://omatsuri.app/page-dividers/).
* Simplified the fonts. The plan was to move to various variations of the rather lovely [Recursive variable font](https://www.recursive.design/) but I had some technical issues, so it's all just Roboto for now.
* Shifted some content around between the Home page and About Me page.

Would like to update the colour palette too, so maybe I'll get around to that in another year or so.
