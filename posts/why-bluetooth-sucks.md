Yesterday I misplaced my wireless earbuds, which I use a lot during teh day for music and work calls. So I dug out an older pair of wireless, over-the-ear headphones (Sony WH-C500).

I charged them up, put them on, switched them on, and a friendly voice in my ear told me "Bluetooth connected".

But what device were they connected to? Not my laptop. Not my phone. Not any of the other phones or tablets in the house. But they're connected to _something_, and until I find out what, I can't actually use them.

What would be really useful: for devices like headphones to have a "disconnect" function, that disconnected them from whatever device they were connected to.
