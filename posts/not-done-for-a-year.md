A list of things that I haven't done for the last year or so, due to covid/lockdowns/etc:

* Been on a bus
* Been on a train
* Been in a pub
* Drunk a pint sourced from a pub
* Shopped in a big supermarket<br>(*although I did nip into big Tesco in September to buy some donuts, and have been into M&S Food a few times*)
* Eaten any food from Greggs
* Been inside a McDonald's<br>(*have had a delivery from there though*)
* Seen any of my family (that I don't live with) in person
* Been more than about 8 miles from our house
* Been to a gig or a festival
* Been to the cinema
* Been inside a bookshop
* Spent a night away from home
* Been on my own for more than, um, 2 hours, I reckon

A year ago, the idea that I might not do any of those things for a year or more would have seemed pretty outlandish. Especially the Greggs one.
