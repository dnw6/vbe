A list of all the different ways and techniques that I use to _try_ to keep track of all the things I want and need to do:

* [Keep](https://keep.google.com)
  * Medium-to-longform notes.
  * Notes that I think I might come back to more than once.
  * Text, links or images that I want to be reminded about at a specific time.
* [Any.do](https://www.any.do/)
  * One-off reminders for personal tasks ("Call the dentist" etc).
  * Recurring menial tasks ("Bins out tonight").
* [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
  * Non-work-related appointments (dentists, school events etc).
* Open browser tabs
  * Stuff I want to read or need to act on in the next 24 hours or so. Firefox for work stuff, Chrome for personal stuff.
* [Momentum browser plugin](https://momentumdash.com/)
  * A simple virtual list for tasks I want to do today or the next day.
* Lists written out on paper
  * When I'm trying to hold too many things in my head and just need to get it recorded somewhere for reference.
* Items scribbled on post-it notes
  * Transient one-off work items when I don't have the time/focus to create a virtual to-do. I try very hard to avoid these, but they do creep in.
* Slack 
  * Reminders: Anything that comes in via Slack that I can't/don't want to deal with immediately.
  * Saved items: A collection of things that I remember to look at once a year, if that.
  * Draft messages: Messages I need to respond to/haven't finished responding to.
  * Messages marked as unread after I've read them: See above.
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
  * At work I have a personal to-do board set up that I use effectively in short bursts, and then forget about, and then don't use for a while because of the effort it takes to clear it out and make it fit for purpose again.
  * Sometimes I remember to look at all my outstanding tickets, have a mild panic attack, then don't look again for a few weeks.
  * I really hate Jira.
* [Trello](https://www.atlassian.com/software/trello)
  * I have a private board that I use for tracking work tasks. I use the Jira power-up to link to Jira tasks when relevant.
  * Also have several shared boards that are not maintained frequently enough to make them actually useful.
* Emails 
  * Opened in their own window: Messages that I don't want to forget about that and definitely need a response/action before the end of the day
  * Marked as unread after I read them: See above.
  * Sent to myself: Usually things I want to read or refer to at work.
  * Snoozed messages: Usually non-work-related life admin stuff that I don't have time to deal with at work, so I snooze emails until the evening, when I'm too tired to care about doing them, so I snooze them until the following morning.
* Outlook tasks
  * When I know a work email needs my attention, but I don't have time to extract it out into any of the other systems I use, I'll sometimes drag it onto the Tasks tab. Where it withers and dies, never to be looked at again.
* Files saved on my desktop
  * Files saved somewhere visible that relate to something that needs doing in a vague-but-still-somehow-urgent timeframe. Every couple of months I will stare at huge clusters of them, baffled as to what they could possibly be or mean, before uneasily deleting them all. 
* Sleeping my laptop instead of shutting it down so the currently open windows and tabs remind me what I was doing when I open it up again.
