I've updated the site design a little. Mainly all this colour that you see around you, but also adding in some curves and organic shapes.

Thanks to [The Separator Generator](https://wweb.dev/resources/css-separator-generator) for the nice curvy line betwixt header and content.

And also to [UI Gradients](https://uigradients.com/#MegaTron) for the colour inspiration, even if I went with solid colours in the end.

And also also to this [Fancy Border Radius Generator](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/#30.41.42.32--.) which saved me having to noodle around with an svg for a blob shaped background (although I do quite enjoy noodling around with svgs, so maybe I'll update this bit in the future).

I need to make the layout work better on smaller screens, but everything should at least be legible on most devices.
