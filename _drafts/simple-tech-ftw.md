Last week, someone I built a website for in the past got in touch for the first time in 3 years and asked me to make some updates to the site.

I built the site in 2012 - that's a long time ago, especially in web years. I built it using the tech I was familiar with at the time, which was hand-coded html, css, and a couple of jQuery plugins. No Sass. No JS framework of any kind. No build processes. It doesn't even have any includes or partials - if I need to update teh navigation (which I've done precisely once in the last 12 years) I go into each of the half a dozen html files, and replicate the change in all of them.
