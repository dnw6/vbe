        <h3>I made three New Year's Resolutions in 2020:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy some new glasses (been meaning to do this for nearly a decade)</li>
                <li>Start a blog (again)</li>
                <li>Can't remember the third one</li>
            </ul>
                <p><em>Hence this site.</em> Starting off with a really basic theme, plan is to slowly make it look... less basic. No rush though, is there?</p>
                <p>2021 update: still haven't bought new glasses.</p>
