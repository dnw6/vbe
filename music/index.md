<hr>

In 2015 I moved from London to Southport, which entailed packing my turntables and all of my vinyl up into boxes, and temporarily stacking it all in the shed of our new, somewhat bijou house, until such time as we'd bought a bigger house with enough space for me to set it up. 

Well, suffice to say we haven't bought a bigger house, and all my music stuff is still in boxes in the shed, so I bought myself a [Pioneer DDJ-400](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-gb/product/controller/ddj-400/black/overview/), which I can quickly and easily set up on the kitchen top, in-between the toaster and the biscuit tin:

The mixes above are ones I've recorded whilst I learn how to use my new toy...
